# knkode — Handoff

## What Was Done
- [done] Bug fix: UI layout, accessibility & polish (PR #12)
- [done] Bug fix: UI testing bugs — drag region, split dirs, settings shortcut, focus indicator (PR #14)
- [done] Tailwind CSS v4 migration — all inline styles → Tailwind classes (PR #16)

## Active Decisions
- Tech stack: Electron + React + TypeScript + xterm.js + node-pty + Zustand
- Styling: **Tailwind CSS v4** with @tailwindcss/vite plugin, semantic color tokens in @theme
- Package manager: bun | Linter: Biome | Test runner: Vitest
- Config storage: ~/.knkode/ (JSON files)
- PTY lifecycle: store-managed (ensurePty/killPtys/removePtyId) — decoupled from React mount

## What's Next
- Follow-up: Extract ghost button pattern (bg-transparent border-none...) to @layer components
- Follow-up: Focus trap for SettingsPanel modal (`aria-modal` expects containment)
- Follow-up: Extract `useContextMenu` hook (DRY)
- Follow-up: Context menu keyboard navigation (arrow keys, role="menu")
- Follow-up: Additional test coverage for renderer components
